/* [John Elliott, 15 July 2001] 
 * Copied this file into ZXCC, a CP/M emulator.
 * Since ZXCC's memory is a flat 64k space and will never be bank-switched,
 * the bank-switching code is removed.
 * Since ZXCC has no memory-mapped screen, all the screen management code
 * goes as well.
 * Since ZXCC doesn't need its speed regulated, all the speed regulation
 * code goes as well.
 * Since ZXCC doesn't save or load snapshots... OK, you get the idea.
