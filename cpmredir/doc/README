CPMREDIR 1.1.1                                      John Elliott, 28 March 2003 
===============================================================================

  CPMREDIR is a library intended to support the filesystem functions of 
an emulated CP/M computer, in a Unix or Windows (mingw32) environment. 
Earlier versions also supported DOS; the source should still compile on DOS, 
but the autoconf scripts have not been tested on this platform.

Using CPMREDIR
==============

1.  #include "cpmredir.h" in your source files
2.  Add libcpmredir.a (libcpmrd.a in DOS) to your link line. 

  If you intend to use CPMREDIR as your emulator's only filesystem, then 
just call it from your emulated BDOS. CPMREDIR emulates a CP/M 4 BDOS, 
which should allow most CP/M 2 and 3 programs to run.
  If you intend to use CPMREDIR as a secondary filesystem, the files
"sample.c" and "Z80/cpmredir.rsx" may help. They provide a mechanism for 
CPMREDIR to filter BDOS calls, and decide whether CPMREDIR or the existing
BDOS should handle them.

  CPMREDIR assumes that it will be able to access the CP/M RAM as a 
linear range, and therefore addresses will be passed in as pointers. If
your emulator does not have a linear address space (eg: you are emulating 
banked memory, or using a segmented architecture) you will have to use 
"copy in and copy out" techniques in your code. 
  CPMREDIR does not make any assumptions about your CPU emulation. It should
be possible for it to work with emulated CP/M-86, though it has only been
tested with emulated CP/M-80.

  The following functions are provided:  

int fcb_init(void);

	Initialise. Returns 0 if initialisation failed.

void fcb_deinit(void);

	Uninitialise.

void xlt_name(char *localname, char *cpmname);

	  Translate a name from the host FS to a CP/M name. This will (if 
        necessary) create a mapping between a CP/M drive and a host directory 
        path. 
 	  CP/M drives A: to O: can be mapped in this way. P: is always the 
        current drive. 
	  This is intended for parsing command-line arguments.

int xlt_map(int drive, char *localdir);

	  It is sometimes convenient to set some fixed mappings. This will 
        create a mapping for a given directory.  
          Pass drive = -1 for "first available", or 0-15 for A: to P:
          Returns 1 if OK, 0 if requested drive not available. 
 
          NB: It is important that the localname should have a trailing 
        directory separator (eg: "/usr/lib/cpm/" not "/usr/lib/cpm")

int xlt_umap(int drive);

	  This revokes a mapping. No check is made whether CP/M has files open
	on the drive or not.

char *xlt_getcwd(int drive);

	  Find out if a drive is mapped, and if so to what directory. If a 
        drive is not mapped, it returns a blank string.

BDOS functions:
===============

  As a rule, these functions return a word which should be put in BA and HL.
Sometimes they return a byte for A and L.

cpm_byte fcb_reset (void);		           /* 0x0D */
cpm_word fcb_drive (cpm_byte drv);                 /* 0x0E */
cpm_word fcb_open  (cpm_byte *fcb, cpm_byte *dma); /* 0x0F */
cpm_word fcb_close (cpm_byte *fcb);		   /* 0x10 */
cpm_word fcb_find1 (cpm_byte *fcb, cpm_byte *dma); /* 0x11 */
cpm_word fcb_find2 (cpm_byte *fcb, cpm_byte *dma); /* 0x12 */
cpm_word fcb_unlink(cpm_byte *fcb, cpm_byte *dma); /* 0x13 */
cpm_word fcb_read  (cpm_byte *fcb, cpm_byte *dma); /* 0x14 */
cpm_word fcb_write (cpm_byte *fcb, cpm_byte *dma); /* 0x15 */
cpm_word fcb_creat (cpm_byte *fcb, cpm_byte *dma); /* 0x16 */
cpm_word fcb_rename(cpm_byte *fcb, cpm_byte *dma); /* 0x17 */
cpm_word fcb_logvec(void);                         /* 0x18 */
cpm_byte fcb_getdrv(void);                         /* 0x19 */

Note: There is no separate "set DMA" call. The DMA address is passed as a
     parameter to other calls.

cpm_word fcb_getalv(cpm_byte *alv, cpm_word max);  /* 0x1B */

      "Get allocation vector" returns an entirely fictitious allocation vector.
     The caller must give an address to write it, and available space for it.

cpm_word fcb_rodisk(void);			   /* 0x1C */
cpm_word fcb_rovec (void);                         /* 0x1D */
cpm_word fcb_chmod (cpm_byte *fcb, cpm_byte *dma); /* 0x1E */
cpm_word fcb_getdpb(cpm_byte *dpb);                /* 0x1F */

 	"Get DPB" writes 17 bytes to memory at "dpb". The DPB is not 
       terribly realistic.

cpm_byte fcb_user  (cpm_byte usr);		   /* 0x20 */

        User numbers are not emulated, so this call is of little
       practical use.        

cpm_word fcb_randrd(cpm_byte *fcb, cpm_byte *dma); /* 0x21 */
cpm_word fcb_randwr(cpm_byte *fcb, cpm_byte *dma); /* 0x22 */
cpm_word fcb_stat  (cpm_byte *fcb);		   /* 0x23 */
cpm_word fcb_tell  (cpm_byte *fcb);		   /* 0x24 */
cpm_word fcb_resro (cpm_word bitmap);	           /* 0x25 */

	The MP/M Access Drives and Free Drives calls are not supported. 

cpm_word fcb_randwz(cpm_byte *fcb, cpm_byte *dma); /* 0x28 */

	The MP/M record locking calls not supported.

cpm_word fcb_multirec(cpm_byte rc);		   /* 0x2C */

	  "Set hardware error action" must be done by the caller.
        CPMREDIR will always assume the action is "return an error and
        report no message".

cpm_word fcb_dfree (cpm_byte drive, cpm_byte *dma);/* 0x2E */
cpm_word fcb_sync  (cpm_byte flag);		   /* 0x30 */
cpm_word fcb_purge (void);			   /* 0x62 */

	  This call acts just like fcb_sync(0). 

cpm_word fcb_trunc (cpm_byte *fcb, cpm_byte *dma); /* 0x63 */
cpm_word fcb_setlbl(cpm_byte *fcb, cpm_byte *dma); /* 0x64 */

	  "Set disc label" has no effect.

cpm_word fcb_getlbl(cpm_byte drive);               /* 0x65 */
cpm_word fcb_date  (cpm_byte *fcb);		   /* 0x66 */
cpm_word fcb_setpwd(cpm_byte *fcb, cpm_byte *dma); /* 0x67 */
cpm_word fcb_defpwd(cpm_byte *pwd);                /* 0x6A */
cpm_word fcb_sdate (cpm_byte *fcb, cpm_byte *dma); /* 0x74 */

	  The "Set date stamp" call as in CP/M-86 4.1 (DOSPLUS).

cpm_word fcb_parse (char     *txt, cpm_byte *fcb); /* 0x98 */

	  fcb_parse() returns the length of the filename parsed, 0 if EOL, 
        0xFFFF if error.
