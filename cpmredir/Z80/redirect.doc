Redirection tools for CP/M emulators            John Elliott, 16 February 1999
==============================================================================

  The Redirection tools are a set of programs allowing you to use a DOS 
or UNIX directory as a CP/M drive. They are designed to be used inside a CP/M 3
emulator.

* REDIR.COM   is the Z80 end of SAMPLE.C; it is an example of how to use
             CPMREDIR as an additional filesystem in an existing emulator.

                  REDIR     - to turn redirection on.
                  REDIR [U] - to turn redirection off.

* MOUNT.COM   will connect a CP/M drive to a DOS directory:

                  MOUNT N:=C:/TEXT/

              makes CP/M able to access the directory C:/TEXT as CP/M drive N:.

              Since CP/M automatically converts the command line to upper case,
              MOUNT can't really access lower-case directories like this.
              Therefore, if you type

                  MOUNT \

              you will be able to append the command line as required:

                  A>MOUNT \
                  MOUNT>L:=/usr/src/linux/

* UMOUNT.COM  disconnects a CP/M drive:

                  UMOUNT N:

              will stop drive N: from being a DOS directory. If you find that 
              MOUNT.COM reports that a drive is already in use, then use UMOUNT 
              to disconnect it and the MOUNT to reconnect it.

* LSDIR.COM   can be used as an alternative to DIR; it includes subdirectories 
              in its listing. 

* CHDIR.COM   is used to select a new directory on the current drive. Examples:

                CHDIR TEXT
                CHDIR ..

               Note: a command like    CHDIR C:\DATA\PCW  is not acceptable. You 
                    would have to use two commands:
                                       
                                       CHDIR DATA
                                       CHDIR PCW

* MKDIR.COM   is used to create a new subdirectory in the current directory.
* RMDIR.COM   is used to delete an empty subdirectory in the current directory.


General points
==============

  Most CP/M programs will work with a redirected drive. Disc editors and 
unerase programs will not.

  Under DRDOS, password protection will work. Under MSDOS, it won't.
