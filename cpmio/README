CPMIO 1.1.1                                         John Elliott, 28 March 2003
===============================================================================

  CPMIO is a library intended to support the console access functions of 
an emulated CP/M computer, on a Unix box.

  I wrote CPMIO to avoid reinventing wheels. I had written an emulator,
and wanted to improve its abysmal I/O. This library is the result.

Using CPMIO
===========

  CPMIO was based on the terminal control functions in MYZ80, making allowances
for the different screen model of Curses as opposed to the PC.

1.  #include "cpmio.h" in your source files
2.  Add libcpmio.a to your link line. 
3.  You will also need to link with the Curses or NCurses libraries.

  The following functions are provided:  

void cpm_scr_init(void);	/* Initialise */

       Call this first; it switches the terminal into raw mode and sets up
     various variables. If the environment variable CPMTERM is set to the name
     of a terminal, that terminal will be used; otherwise, the standard 
     "TERMIOS" terminal will be selected.

void cpm_scr_unit(void);	/* Terminate */

       Call this when your program terminates; it restores the terminal to 
     the state in which it found it.

char cpm_const(void);		/* Console status */
char cpm_conin(void);		/* Console input */
void cpm_conout(char c);	/* Console output */


       These functions behave just like the BIOS functions of the same name. 
     Note that cpm_const() does not attempt to detect whether a program is 
     repeatedly calling CONST with nothing in between; your program will have 
     to perform this detection if it needs the functionality.

int           cpm_bdos_1(void);
int           cpm_bdos_2(char c);
int           cpm_bdos_6(unsigned char c);
int           cpm_bdos_9(char *buf);
int           cpm_bdos_10(char *buf);

        You need to check if DE=0 before calling this function. If it is, then
      your program must pass in the line at the DMA address; and if it isn't,
      then it must set buf[1] to 0. 

int           cpm_bdos_11(void);
unsigned int  cpm_bdos_109(unsigned int de);
unsigned char cpm_bdos_110(unsigned int de);
int           cpm_bdos_111(char *buf, unsigned int len);

        All of the functions declared as returning "int" will return -1 if 
      Control-C was pressed and the emulated program should terminate. Those
      that don't normally return values (numbers 2, 9, 10 and 111) will 
      return 0 if Control-C was not pressed.

int cpm_bdos_set_get_typeahead(int flag);

   Call this if the Typeahead flag (byte at SCB + 30h) is changed. You 
should pass in the new value of this byte, or -1 to read the current value.
There should not be any need to use this function except in your Get/Set SCB
emulation.

char *cpm_get_terminal(void);		/* Gets terminal ID */
int   cpm_set_terminal(char *s);	/* Sets terminal ID, eg "RAW" "VT52" */
void  cpm_enum_terminals(char *s);	/* List all terminal IDs */

int cpm_term_direct(int function, int param); /* Direct control of terminal */

/* Functions for term_direct: */

#define CPM_TERM_INIT      0	/* Initialise a terminal */
#define CPM_TERM_GETATTR   1	/* Get bold/reverse etc */
#define CPM_TERM_SETATTR   2	/* Set bold/reverse etc */
#define CPM_TERM_GETCOLOUR 3	/* Get screen colour as byte */
#define CPM_TERM_SETCOLOUR 4	/* Set screen colour as byte */
#define CPM_TERM_CLEAR     5	/* Clear screen */
#define CPM_TERM_MOVE      6	/* Move cursor */
#define CPM_TERM_IFCOLOUR  7	/* Is this a colour screen? */
#define CPM_TERM_CHAR     20	/* Write character */
#define CPM_TERM_HEIGHT   60	/* Get/set terminal height */
#define CPM_TERM_WRAP     61    /* Get/set wrap mode */


char *cpm_get_terminal(void);		/* Gets terminal ID */

       CPMIO has multiple terminal emulations. This returns an ASCII string 
     giving the name of the current terminal.

int   cpm_set_terminal(char *s);	/* Sets terminal ID */

       Select a terminal emulation. CPMIO currently supports:

       "TERMIOS" (default): No emulation. All control sequences are passed 
                           as-is to the terminal.

       The other emulations use the Curses or NCurses cursor control libraries:

       "RAW"              All characters are passed as-is to the Curses library.
                        This terminal is only for debugging purposes; it is
                        unusable as a terminal. 
       "GENERIC"   }      ANSI-style emulation, based on the emulation in 
       "ANSI"      }    the MYZ80 emulator. 
       "VT52"             VT52 emulation, based on the Amstrad PCW terminal.

void  cpm_enum_terminals(char *s);	/* List all terminal IDs */

         Fills a buffer at s with the names of all terminal emulations 
       supported; each one is terminated with a zero, and the buffer ends 
       with two zeroes.

int cpm_term_direct(int function, int param); /* Direct control of terminal */

         The following operations are designed so that terminal operations 
       can be performed irrespective of the current terminal emulation. The 
       first parameter is the function:

CPM_TERM_INIT:         Initialise the terminal. This is done when the 
                      terminal is selected and should not need doing again. 
CPM_TERM_GETATTR:      Return text styles. Bit 0: bright
                                           Bit 1: underscore
                                           Bit 2: blink
                                           Bit 3: reverse 
CPM_TERM_SETATTR       Select the combination of text styles in "param".
CPM_TERM_GETCOLOUR     Get the screen colour. Returns foreground in bits 0-3;
                      background in bits 4-7.
CPM_TERM_SETCOLOUR     Set the screen colour in "param", as in 
                      CPM_TERM_GETCOLOUR	
CPM_TERM_CLEAR         Clear the screen
CPM_TERM_MOVE          Move the cursor. Bits 7-0 of "param" give X coordinate, 
                                            15-8 give Y (zero-based)
CPM_TERM_IFCOLOUR     Return 1 if this is a colour terminal
CPM_TERM_CHAR         Write "param" as a character. Returns 1 if the screen
                     should be refreshed, else 0.
CPM_TERM_HEIGHT       If "param" is -1, return current terminal height. Else
                     set it to "param".
CPM_TERM_WRAP         If "param" is -1, return current wrap setting (1=wrap
                     at end of line, 0=don't). Else set it to "param". 

  These functions are not available for the TERMIOS terminal.


More terminals
==============

  If you want to add an extra terminal (eg: VT220) to CPMIO, do the following:

1. Copy term_vt52.c or term_ansi.c to (eg) term_vt220.c . In this case, 
  term_ansi.c is obviously the closer match. Rename the term_ansi() function
  at the bottom to term_vt220(). You can delete the term_generic() function 
  from this file; it is there because term_ansi contains two almost identical
  emulations (ANSI and GENERIC).

2. In lib/Makefile.am:  Add term_vt220.c to the "libcpmio_a_SOURCES = " line.
3. In cpmio_i.h: Add a prototype for vt220_term() to the "Terminals" section.
4. In cpmio.c:   Add "VT220" to the term_desc[] array, and vt220_term() to the 
   term_funcs array.
5. Modify the functions in term_vt220.c.
